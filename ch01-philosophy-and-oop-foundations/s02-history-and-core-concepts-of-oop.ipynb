    "-   **Structure:** The program is organized around **functions** that perform a specific task.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Data and Functions:** Data is typically separated from the functions that manipulate it. Data structures are passed to functions for processing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Top-Down Design:** The program is often designed by breaking the main task into smaller sub-tasks.\n",

    "-   **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods.\n",

    "-   **Inheritance:** The ability of a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass), promoting code reuse.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Polymorphism:** The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same message (method call) in a way that is specific to their class.\n",

    "-   **Structure:** The program is organized around **classes** and **objects**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Data and Functions:** Data and the functions that operate on it are tightly coupled (encapsulated) within objects.\n",

    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation** is the principle of bundling **data** (attributes) and the **methods** (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (the **object**). It also involves **data hiding**, restricting direct access to an object's internal data, forcing interaction through defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Think of a modern car. You interact with it using defined controls (steering wheel, pedals). You don't directly manipulate the engine's spark plugs or fuel injectors. The engine's inner workings are _encapsulated_ within the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose in OOP:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Modularity:** It creates self-contained modules that are easier to test and maintain.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Data Protection:** It prevents accidental or unauthorized modification of data by outside code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Code Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, encapsulation is achieved using a naming convention: prefixing an attribute name with a single underscore (`_`) suggests it's intended to be protected (though it can still be accessed) or double underscores (`__`) to invoke name mangling, making it harder to access from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, initial_balance):\n",

    "## Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It focuses on **what** an object does rather than **how** it does it.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Python Code Example:**\n",
    "Here, the user only interacts with the `draw()` method. They don't need to know the specific mathematical or graphics library calls inside the method; those details are abstracted. Python uses the `abc` module to enforce abstraction via abstract classes and methods.\n",
