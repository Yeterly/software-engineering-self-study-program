    "## Subtype Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subtype polymorphism** (often just called **polymorphism** in OOP) is the ability for a function or method to work with objects of different classes, as long as those classes share a common structure or **interface**. This common structure is typically established through **inheritance** from a base class or by implementing methods defined in an **abstract base class (ABC)**. The core idea is that an object can be treated as an instance of its parent type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental principle is: **\"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Example: Subtype Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, polymorphism is natural. When you call a method on an object, the interpreter figures out which specific implementation to use at runtime based on the object's actual class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Base class defining the common interface (method signature)\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def travel(self):\n",
    "        # This is a generic method that subclasses will override\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError(\"Subclass must implement abstract method 'travel'\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Subclasses (subtypes)\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def travel(self):\n",
    "        return \"The car drives on the road.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Plane(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def travel(self):\n",
    "        return \"The plane flies through the air.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Boat(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def travel(self):\n",
    "        return \"The boat sails on the water.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# A function that can accept any object that is a 'Vehicle' (or a subtype of it)\n",
    "def describe_travel(vehicle: Vehicle):\n",
    "    # This call is polymorphic; it works for Car, Plane, or Boat objects\n",
    "    print(vehicle.travel())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create instances of different subtypes\n",
    "my_car = Car()\n",

    "# The same function call executes different code based on the object's type\n",
    "describe_travel(my_car)   # Output: The car drives on the road.\n",
    "describe_travel(my_plane) # Output: The plane flies through the air.\n",
    "describe_travel(my_boat)  # Output: The boat sails on the water.\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `describe_travel` function exhibits **subtype polymorphism**. It doesn't care whether the object passed to it is a `Car`, `Plane`, or `Boat`; it only requires that the object is a subtype of `Vehicle` and therefore has a `travel()` method."

    "## Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "An **interface** defines a contract: a set of method signatures that a class must implement. It specifies _what_ a class should do, but not _how_ it should do it. Interfaces decouple the implementation details from the usage, supporting polymorphism.\n",
